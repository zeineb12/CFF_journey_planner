# CFF-Robust-Journey-Planner

Imagine you are a regular user of the public transport system, and you are checking the operatorâ€™s schedule to meet your friends for a class reunion. The choices are:

You could leave in 10mins, and arrive with enough time to spare for gossips before the reunion starts.

You could leave now on a different route and arrive just in time for the reunion.

Undoubtedly, if this is the only information available, most of us will opt for option 1.

If we now tell you that option 1 carries a fifty percent chance of missing a connection and be late for the reunion. Whereas, option 2 is almost guaranteed to take you there on time. Would you still consider option 1?

Probably not. However, most public transport applications will insist on the first option. This is because they are programmed to plan routes that offer the shortest travel times, without considering the risk factors.

Using the CFF dataset, we wanted to build our own public transport route planner to improve on that.
